To strengthen my expertise in Infrastructure as Code (IaC), cloud provisioning, and automation, I actively refer to official Terraform resources provided by HashiCorp. Below are the primary references I use for continuous learning and practical implementation.

## Official Terraform Website  
https://www.terraform.io/

Provides product information, installation guides, enterprise features, and official updates directly from HashiCorp.

Includes:
